The following are various assignments completed during my study period at york university. The include python and java assignments which focus on data structures, machine learning principals and practical business uses.

EECS4312FinalProjectBartolomeoGisone: A Jupyter Notebook Python 3 file which takes a csv file and parses through the data to extract information on multiple apps. The data is then lemmatized and stop words are removed for further analysis. The data is ran through 2 sentimant analysis programs, and high sentiment information on app is presented to show what users enjoyed about using the app.

EECS4404FinalProj: A Jupyter Notebook Python 3 file which uses machine learning through Naive Bayes to predict if a sentence is similar a group sentences. The program could be further expanded upon by using synonyms gathered from the internet to improve accuracy.

the three eecs3216 files: shows knowedge of the c programing language and basic finite state machines and parsing through files

topten: A Jupyter Notebook Python 3 file which parses through a user input file (in this case, the lyrics to 'Living on a Prayer' by Bon Jovi were used to test file). Using Key Value pairs and Big Data principals, the top 10 words in the song graphed and displayed.

Lab4: Shows a Java program which creates dynamic Queues and Stacks, and creates a Queue from two Stacks. 

Gisone_Test2: shows a basic java web application with servlets, a SQL database and MVC design pattern
